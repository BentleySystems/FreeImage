# Bentley FreeImage
## About

This is a fork of the unmaintained FreeImage library (https://freeimage.sourceforge.io/). 

3rd Party libraries have been upgraded to mitigate security issues, and fixes have been applied to the FreeImage plugin code.

## Build

FreeImage has been updated to build with Visual Studio 2022 and the C++ v143 toolset. You will need to add the "C++ Core Features" and "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/86 build tools" components when installing Visual Studio to build.

Open FreeImage.2022.sln to start.
